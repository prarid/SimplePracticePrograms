# SimplePracticePrograms

### Mainly Python, some Pandas and Numpy

These are some practice programs when I was first learning python and some of the more popular libraries like pandas and numpy. Most of the code here is very basic and the focus is to learn/practice some aspect of the library. I'm leaving it here as practice examples if its useful to someone else.
