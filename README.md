# SimplePracticePrograms

### mainly python and EDA libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib

Simple programs/projects from when I was first learning these libraries. The focus here is to learn/practice some aspect of the library through exploratory data analysis and simple visualizations. I don't expect the projects in this repository to include statistical modeling or other more complex techniques.
